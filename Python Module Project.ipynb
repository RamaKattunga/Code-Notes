    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the capstone project for Module 1 of the [Code You](https://code-you.org/) Introduction to Python course! You’ve spent seven weeks learning Python, from printing messages to handling files and modules. Now, you’ll apply those skills in the Smart Personal Finance Analyzer, a command-line program that manages financial transactions. This project will help you build a portfolio-ready application to impress employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll work with a CSV file called `financial_transactions.csv`, add and modify transactions, calculate financial summaries, and save your work. The instructions are clear, designed for beginners, with hints to guide you without giving full solutions. Even a 7th grader can follow along!"
